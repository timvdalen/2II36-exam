## Social networks

### 12. Describe key statistical properties of large-scale networks across various domains. You should cover, but not necessary limit yourself to power-laws, small world, densification and shrinking diameter.
### 13. Consider key ideas behind the small-world model, and discuss its consequences, relevance and limitations with respect to the real large-scale networks.
### 14. Consider key ideas behind the preferential attachment and the edge-copying models, and discuss their relevance and limitations with respect to the real large-scale networks.
### 15. Consider key ideas behind the community guided attachment and forest-fire models, and discuss their relevance and limitations with respect to the large-scale networks. 
### 16. How does information/diseases spread through networks? Discuss different diffusion models (e.g., threshold, independent contagion, general contagion).   
### 17. Explain how you can find the most influential subset of nodes in a network.
### 18. Explain how you can best detect cascades in a network. Discuss the rewards you can optimize on versus the costs.
### 19. Explain a way of measuring the similarity of nodes in homogeneous networks (e.g. SimRank). Consider advantages and disadvantages of the approach, how it can be combined with some other idea(s).
### 20. Explain a way of measuring the similarity of nodes in heterogeneous networks (e.g. PathSim). Consider advantages and disadvantages of the approach, how it can be combined with some other idea(s).
